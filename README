A simple GTK clock written in C. This was an experiment to figure out
the GTK libraries.

The clock consists out of a few rings, each represents a certain part
of the current time (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months).

No Makefile, but compiling is pretty simple:

gcc -Wall -g clock_date.c clock.c -o clock \ 
   `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0` `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0 cairo`

There might be better ways of redrawing the whole canvas, but that
was outside the scope of the intended goal.
